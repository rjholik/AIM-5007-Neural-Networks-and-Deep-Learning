This repository is for AIM 5007 Neural Networks and Deep Learning course, which was taught at the  Katz School of Science and Health. Throughout this course, I had the opportunity to explore the fascinating world of deep learning and neural networks, and to gain practical experience in implementing these techniques in a variety of applications. Through a combination of lectures, assignments, and projects, I learned about the fundamentals of deep learning, including popular architectures such as convolutional neural networks, optimization methods and regularization techniques. I hope that my work serves as a valuable resource for anyone who is interested in learning more about this rapidly evolving and exciting field.
